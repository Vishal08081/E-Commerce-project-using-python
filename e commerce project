This project was an incredible learning journey with The iScale. where I applied data analysis techniques to solve real-world challenges such as:

1 Monthly Sales Analysis: Identified the months with the highest and lowest sales.

2 Category Sales Analysis: Determined the product category with the highest and lowest sales.

3 Sub-Category Insights: Conducted a detailed analysis of sales based on sub-categories.

4 Monthly Profit Analysis: Pinpointed the months with the highest profit.

5 Profit by Category/Sub-Category: Investigated how categories and sub-categories contributed to profit.

6 Customer Segment Analysis: Explored sales and profit trends across different customer segments.

7 Sales-to-Profit Ratio: Analyzed the efficiency of sales translating into profit.

This hands-on experience strengthened my data analytics and Python programming skills, preparing me for larger challenges in the e-commerce domain.

Looking forward to taking on more data-driven projects!
